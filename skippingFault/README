# Skipping Fault Correction Attack

## Prerequisites
For the code, we require the NTL and GMP libraries to be installed.

## Building
`make` builds:
- the adapted C dilithium code
- test_X_skip (X=2,3,5) generates programs that recover the secret key using simulated skipping faults, 10 tests each
- test_X_skip_shuff (X=2,3,5) generates programs that recover the secret key using simulated skipping faults that are injected in random coefficients, 2 tests each
- test_X_skip_ineff (X=2,3,5) generates programs that recover the secret key using only ineffective simulated skipping faults, 5 tests each

We tested this successfully (and without warnings) with gcc version 11.4.0.

## Running
```
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```
runs for each Dilithium parameter set:
- the secret key recovery for all three attack variants
