# Correction Fault Attack on Expansion of A

## Prerequisites
For the code, we the NTL and GMP libraries to be installed.
Furthermore, the machine must feature avx2 instructions (the code will fail with `illegal instruction` if this is not the case).

## Building
`make -j` builds:
- the adapted avx2 dilithium code
- the gen_faulty_sigX (X=2,3,5) programs that generate simulated faulty signatures
- test_X_fA (X=2,3,5) programs that recover the secret key coefficients in NTT domain (note that this, depending on the number of threads available on your system, might run for multiple hours)

We tested this successfully (and without warnings) with gcc versions 11.4.0 and 13.1.0.

## Running
```
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```
runs for each Dilithium parameter set:
- the fault simulation
- the secret key recovery
