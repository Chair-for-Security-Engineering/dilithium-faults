# Lattice Reduction to recover s1 from known coefficients in s1hat

## Prerequisites
For the code, we require the NTL, FPLLL and GMP libraries to be installed.

## Building
`make` builds:
- the C dilithium2 code
- the test_latticered program that recovers s1 polynomials from X known coefficients in s1hat at random positions, for X={240, 128}, BKZ block sizes being {15,30}, testing 8 polynomials each. The blocksize is chosen s.t. all the recoveries were successful in our testing. It can be lowered to achieve faster solving times but risking occasional failed recoveries.

We tested this successfully (and without warnings) with gcc version 11.4.0.

## Running
```
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```
runs the lattice reduction tests
